<h2>v1.0</h2>
<p>BeamMP started late 2019, with the first version being based on JavaScript, and still using the old Bridge (which at the time didn't have a server selection menu). - The bridge was used to suppliment the ingame UI mod, it was the cause of a few problems, and ultimately bulked the ease of installation.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>v1.5</h2>
<p>It later evolved into a more complex version, featuring a revamped UI (added palyer list, ping, and chat), and the Bridge got a server selection menu. It was still very primitive and hard to use, the syncing was bad as players only teleported. It was still cumbersome to get up and running, requiring a mod to be installed into the mods folder, and for the bridge application to be run simultaneously to the game being launched... sounds complicated? it wasn't ideal.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>v2.0</h2>
<p>Now the MP mod has been completely rebuilt in C++, introducing a brand new UI fully integrated into the in-game UI, including an in-game server browser. Everything has been packed into a single and easy to use .exe, resulting in a one-click-run mod, making for a super easy to use multiplayer experince. It's just like openining the vanilla game, but now you can play with your friends!</p>
