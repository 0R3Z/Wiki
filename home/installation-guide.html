<h1>Before You Get Started</h1>
<ul>
  <li>This mod is only compatible with legitimate, Steam versions of the game. “Cracked” game copies are not supported.</li>
  <li>Local mods are not supported, all mods must be server-side mods that are installed on the server. Trying to go around this might lead to suspension of your account.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Windows Installation</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Go to our <a href="https://beammp.com/">official website</a> and download the latest <code>BeamMP_Installer.zip</code> by clicking the green <strong>Download Client</strong> button.</li>
  <li>Open the <code>BeamMP_Installer.zip</code> archive.</li>
  <li>Launch <code>BeamMP_Installer.exe</code> and follow the instructions.</li>
  <li>An icon should appear on your desktop, double click it to run it. You should see a little black window appear and shortly after BeamNG.drive should start.</li>
  <li>Once it started, press “Play” and then “Multiplayer”.</li>
  <li>You will be prompted with a login pop-up, you can either play as a guest (not all servers will allow guests), or create an account on our <a href="https://forum.beammp.com/">forums</a> and then login with those credentials.</li>
  <li>Select any server you like and join it. Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you don't see the multiplayer button, make sure the BeamMP mod is activated, then try pressing CTRL + L.</li>
</ul>
